# 💧 SCADA Pump Simulation – by Joshua

This project simulates pump logic for a SCADA-style water system using Python. It captures real-world dynamics like tank level thresholds, pump activation logic, and variable system noise. Built with operator insight — not just theory — this simulation reflects actual field behavior.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I'm not just simulating data — I'm bringing logic to life. As a licensed water operator and tech-minded builder, I wanted to prove that someone with field experience could also build the tools behind the screen.

Most devs haven't stood in front of the equipment. Most operators haven't written code.

I do both.

## ⚙️ Features

- Dynamic tank levels with noise and randomness
- Pump logic with ON/OFF setpoints
- Matplotlib visualization of tank behavior over time
- Terminal output with real-time color-coded status using Colorama


## 🔍 Use Case Ideas

- Training operators on pump logic behavior
- SCADA simulation prototype for future development
- Proof-of-concept for custom monitoring logic

## 🔮 Roadmap

- ✅ Core pump logic with level tracking
- ✅ Matplotlib visualization
- ✅ Color-coded terminal feedback using `colorama`
- ⏳ Add multiple tanks and inter-tank dynamics
- ⏳ Integration into full SCADA system simulation
- ⏳ Add real-time logic to simulate drawdown and lag across tanks
- 🔒 Basic role-based logging (security foundation for later expansion)
