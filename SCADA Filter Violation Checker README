# SCADA Filter Violation Checker (Supporting Script)

This Python script supports a larger case study project that investigates turbidity violations across multiple filters in a water treatment system. The main analysis was performed using SQL, and this script serves as a verification tool to cross-check findings using the raw SCADA CSV data.

## üîç Project Purpose

The goal of the case study was to:
- Analyze 3 years of SCADA and bench data
- Identify turbidity violations where filter readings exceeded 0.30 NTU
- Investigate potential causes (e.g., calibration errors or human error)
- Provide operational insight based on 22 years of real-world water treatment experience

This script focuses on flagging timestamps where any of the filters exceeded the threshold of **0.30 NTU**, which could suggest potential violations.
